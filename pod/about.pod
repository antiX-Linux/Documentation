About antiX Linux

=head1 SYNOPSIS

antiX is a fast, lightweight and easy to install linux live CD
distribution based on Debian Testing for Intel-AMD x86 compatible
systems. antiX offers users the "antiX Magic" in an environment suitable
for old computers. So don't throw away that old computer yet! The goal
of antiX is to provide a light, but fully functional and flexible free
operating system for both newcomers and experienced users of Linux. It
should run on most computers, ranging from 64MB old PII 266 systems with
pre-configured 128MB swap to the latest powerful boxes. 128MB RAM is
recommended minimum for antiX. The installer needs minimum 2.2GB hard
disk size. antiX can also be used as a fast-booting rescue cd.

At the moment antiX-13 "Luddite" comes as a full distro (c690MB), a base
distro (c400MB) and a core-libre distro (c135MB) for 32 bit and 64 bit
computers. For those who wish to have total control over the install,
use antiX-core and build up.
