The antiX LiveCD and LiveUSB boot just fine on many systems without any
problem.  There are four common problem areas described below.   If this
\&\s-1FAQ\s0 doesn't help you resolve your issue then please be clear about when
in the boot process the problem occurred.  For example, describe the
last thing that was seen on the screen.
.SS "1) Can't get to bootloader"
.IX Subsection "1) Can't get to bootloader"
The bootloader should be the first thing you see after the Power-On
Self Test (\s-1POST\s0).

\fISolutions for finding linuxfs file\fR
.IX Subsection "Solutions for finding linuxfs file"
.PP
Three files are needed to boot the live system, \fIvmlinuz\fR, the Linux
kernel; \fIinitrd.gz\fR the initial file system and boot script, and
finally \fIlinuxfs\fR which contains the entire compressed file system.
The first two are found by the bootloader.  The primary purpose of the
initrd is to find that third file.  If it can't be found, that usually
means the device it is located on could not be created or mounted in the
initrd.
.PP
This is usually because either a driver is missing or, on older
machines, a boot parameter is needed to let a modern kernel access older
hardware.  The most likely cure is a boot parameter.
.PP
If none of the suggestions below work then please report the problem at
the antiX Forums <http://antix.freeforums.org/>.
.IP "Need boot parameter" 4
.IX Item "Need boot parameter"
As the kernel evolves the boot parameters needed to get older hardware
to work have changed.  Here are four likely candidates.
.RS 4
.IP "acpi=off" 4
.IX Item "acpi=off"
This boot parameter is the most likely to work.  You can set it by
selecting \f(CW\*(C`no acpi\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`[F4 Options]\*(C'\fR in the bootloader.
Try this first.
.IP "acpi_use_timer_override=1" 4
.IX Item "acpi_use_timer_override=1"
On some older systems the \f(CW\*(C`acpi=off\*(C'\fR option can disable the
\&\s-1USB\s0 bus.  Think of this option as a weaker form of \f(CW\*(C`acpi=off\*(C'\fR
that will allow you to boot but won't disable the \s-1USB\s0 bus.
Try this after you were able to boot with \f(CW\*(C`acpi=off\*(C'\fR to
see if it allows more hardware to work.
.Sp
\&\fB\f(BI\s-1FIXME:\s0\fB\fR should we add this to the \f(CW\*(C`[F4 Options]\*(C'\fR menu?
.IP "pci=biosirq" 4
.IX Item "pci=biosirq"
This options is a work-around for a \s-1BIOS\s0 that is configured
to only work with older versions of Windows.  The proper
solution is to go into the advanced \s-1BIOS\s0 settings and set
\&\f(CW\*(C`Installed OS\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`Other\*(C'\fR.
.IP "nousb2" 4
.IX Item "nousb2"
This parameter instructs the initrd to disable the usb\-2 bus.  
It is only useful when trying to boot a LiveUSB on a few older
systems.

.SS "3) Blank screen or lose video sync early in boot process"
.IX Subsection "3) Blank screen or lose video sync early in boot process"
The next hurdle in the boot process is at a stage called \fIKernel Mode
Switch\fR or \fIModeset\fR.  This is when the kernel uses the same driver for
th virtual consoles and X\-Windows.  When it works it allows for seamless
switching between those two display modes.  When it doesn't work, the
computer is unusable.  It only happens with certain graphics hardware
and drivers.  But switching to a different graphics driver won't solve a
modeset problem because the modeset happens very early in the boot
process, well before the time when normal graphics drivers are loaded.
.PP
It is usually only a problem on older machines or machines where the
monitor cannot support the video card at its highest resolutions. It
usually happens a few seconds after the boot has started before much
text has been written to the screen:

.Ve
.PP
The solution for this problem is in the \f(CW\*(C`[F5\ Video\ Mode]\*(C'\fR menu
in the bootloader.  Select either \f(CW\*(C`[F5\ Video\ Mode]\*(C'\fR \-\-> \f(CW\*(C`safe\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`[F5\ Video\ Mode]\*(C'\fR \-\-> \f(CW\*(C`vesa\*(C'\fR.
.IP "safe" 4
.IX Item "safe"
Disables Kernel Mode
Setting <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernel_mode_setting>.  This
should suffice to get you past this hurdle.  You can still get good
video performance when this option is used.  The downside is there will
be some flickering and a slight delay when you switch between X\-Windows
and the virtual consoles.
.IP "vesa" 4
.IX Item "vesa"
This is even safer than \f(CW\*(C`safe\*(C'\fR mode.   In addition to disabling Kernel
Mode Setting, it also forces use of the \f(CW\*(C`vesa\*(C'\fR driver when X\-Windows
starts.  Do not expect good video performance when the \f(CW\*(C`vesa\*(C'\fR driver is
used.
.SS "4) X\-Windows does not start"
.IX Subsection "4) X-Windows does not start"
This is usually caused by a problem with the video driver.  Try the two
\&\f(CW\*(C`[F5 Video Mode]\*(C'\fR options in the bootloader menu described in the section
directly above.  You will get better performance with the \f(CW\*(C`safe\*(C'\fR option
but X\-Windows is more likely to work if you use the \f(CW\*(C`vesa\*(C'\fR option.

If you do not have a volume icon, the most likely reason is that  the
drivers for your card is not loaded.  Some older, card and even some of
the newest cards, are not supported by \s-1ALSA.\s0
.SS "Wrong Sound card is set as default"
.IX Subsection "Wrong Sound card is set as default"
Computers often have more than one sound \*(L"card\*(R".  The term card means
audio interface, not a physical card.  For example, a usb sound dongle
counts as a card.  So does any \fIvideo\fR card that has \s-1HDMI\s0 output.  That
is because \s-1HDMI\s0 includes audio as well as video.

On the Live system, the easiest way to enable \s-1USB\s0 automounting is in the
bootloader \f(CW\*(C`[F4 Options]\*(C'\fR menu.  Partitions get automounted under the
\&\fI/media\fR directory. You have the following choices:
.IP "automount" 4
.IX Item "automount"
Automatically mount usb sticks with they are plugged in.  You still must
unmount them before they are unplugged.
.IP "mount usb" 4
.IX Item "mount usb"
In addition to automatically mounting usb sticks when they are plugged
in, mount all usb sticks at boot time.
.IP "mount all" 4
.IX Item "mount all"
In addition to mounting usb sticks when they are plugged in and mounting
all usb sticks at boot time, also mount all hard drive partitions at
boot time.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR Even if no automounting is selected, the Live system will
automatically create \fIfstab\fR entries and mountpoints under \fI/media\fR
whenever a usb stick is plugged in.  This makes it easy for you to mount
usb sticks from within programs like \f(CW\*(C`spacemFM\*(C'\fR file manager.  It also
lets a normal user mount partitions directly from the command line.

If your clock time is always wrong, it is due to one more more of the
following issues.  It is best to address them in this order otherwise
you might have to backtrack.
.IP "Wrong Timezone" 4
.IX Item "Wrong Timezone"

.IP "Wrong Selection of \s-1UTC\s0 versus Localtime" 4
.IX Item "Wrong Selection of UTC versus Localtime"
.PD
.SS "Select Timezone"
.IX Subsection "Select Timezone"
When you boot the LiveCD/USB before you install, you can select the
timezone with the \f(CW\*(C`F3 Timezone]\*(C'\fR menu.  The timezone will also get set
if you select a language with the \f(CW\*(C`[F2 Language]\*(C'\fR menu.  An explicit
timezone will, of course, override a timezone that is associated with a
language.  This setting will carry over to when you install.  You will
also get a change to set the timezone in the graphic installer.
.PP
If you want to set the timezone after you've installed, the easiest
thing (for \fBbase\fR and \fBfull\fR systems) is to use the \fIantiX Control
Centre\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& antiX Control Center \-\-> System \-\-> Set Date and Time
.Ve
.PP
For \fBcore\fR systems or other systems that don't have the control
centre, you can do this from the command line with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& sudo /usr/sbin/dpkg\-reconfigure tzdata
.Ve
.PP
Do this first. You should also be able to check the current value
with
.PP
.Vb 1
\& cat /etc/timezone
.Ve
.ie n .SS "Set System Time with the ""date"" Command"
.el .SS "Set System Time with the \f(CWdate\fP Command"
.IX Subsection "Set System Time with the date Command"
.SS "Select \s-1UTC\s0 or Local Time for Hardware Clock"
.IX Subsection "Select UTC or Local Time for Hardware Clock"
Once you are sure the timezone is correct, you can work on setting your
hardware clock.  You must decide if you want your hardware clock set to
Coordinated Universal Time (\s-1UTC\s0) or local time.  It is best to use \s-1UTC\s0
because this way it does not have to change if you move and change time
zones.  But if you are dual booting with a Windows system then you
should leave your hardware clock set to local time and let Windows make
the timezone and daylight savings time adjustments.
.PP
\&\fB\f(BI\s-1NOTE:\s0\fB\fR If you use local time in your hardware clock then you
and you are not dual booting with Windows then you will have to
manually adjust for daylight savings time.
.PP
You configure the hardware clock with the \f(CW\*(C`hwclock\*(C'\fR command.  First
do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& man hwclock
.Ve
.PP
and then run:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& sudo /sbin/hwclock \-\-show
.Ve
.PP
to see what it is set to. It always reports in local time which is why
you need to first make sure your timezone is set correctly.  Use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& sudo /sbin/hwclock \-\-localtime
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sudo /sbin/hwclock \-\-utc
.Ve
.PP
depending on whether you want your hardware clock to be set to local time
or \s-1UTC. \s0
.PP
\&\fB\f(BI\s-1ZZZZZZZZ\s0\fB\fR
.SS "Hardware clock"
.IX Subsection "Hardware clock"
Then, after you get your date command working via the sudo command you
posted, you can use \*(L"hwclock \-\-systohc\*(R" to set the hardware clock so it
matches your system time. Again, you need the timezone and
local\-time/UTC choice set correctly first (although if you want to
*assume* they are set correctly already then this is the only command
you need to run to get your changes to the \*(L"date\*(R" command to stick. If
you assumed incorrectly then you will likely get mysteriously screwed by
\&\s-1DST\s0 a few times per year).
.SS "Time drift"
.IX Subsection "Time drift"
Finally, if you are having problems with hwclock drift or if you are a
perfectionist then you can install the \f(CW\*(C`ntp\*(C'\fR package which will use
time servers on the net to keep your clock exactly on time. But you have
to first go through the steps above before ntp will work correctly.
.SH "Keyboard Layout"
.IX Header "Keyboard Layout"
.SS "Set up the selection of keyboard layouts"
.IX Subsection "Set up the selection of keyboard layouts"
The easiest way to set the keyboard layout is with the \f(CW\*(C`[F2 Language]\*(C'\fR
menu in the Live bootloader.   In addition to setting the language, this
will also set the keyboard layout and timezone.  These settings will be
automatically transfer when you install.
.PP
\&\fB\f(BI\s-1FIXME:\s0\fB\fR Are the following instructions correct?
.PP
If you want to choose your own custom selection of keyboard layouts or
if you want to change the list of keyboard layouts that are accessible
then you have to set the layouts manually.  For example, let's say you
want to be able to choose between French, Greek, and Spanish layouts.
To get this change to happen immediately, run the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  setxkbmap \-layout fr,el,es
.Ve
.PP
To make the change permanent so it will be remembered across reboots,

The easiest way to select a keyboard layout is with the \f(CW\*(C`fbxkb\*(C'\fR
application running in the system tray.  It will display the flag
associated with the language of the current layout.  Click on the flag
to cycle through the different layouts you have chosen in the previous
step.  This application can only handle up to four different layouts at
the same time.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`fbxkb\*(C'\fR is not available or if you just prefer to use the command
line, you can select which keyboard layout to use with the \f(CW\*(C`setxkbmap\*(C'\fR
program.  For example, to set the current layout to French, use the
command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& setxkblayout fr
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBHint:\fR if you want to play around with this, first use this command to
set the layout to one that you are comfortable with.  Then if you set it
to a layout that is confusing, you can use the <Up\-Arrow> key to get
back to the command that sets the layout to the one you are familiar
with.  The <Up\-Arrow> and <Enter> keys are the same in all keyboard
layouts.
